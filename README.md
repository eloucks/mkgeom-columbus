# mkgeom-columbus

This is a C-shell script (*cringe) for the conversion of a Gaussian geometry optimization calculation log file into a input geom file for the Columbus Computational Chemistry package. 

At this moment, this script **only supports C<sub>2v</sub> symmetry molecules.** Additionally, it will only function for atoms with atomic numbers of Flourine of less. This shouldn't be an issue for most organic molecules, but if you are working in a niche case, it could be a deal breaker.

I'm not maintaining this script, but if you run into an issue, I might still help you depending on the complexity of the problem/request.

Cheers!
